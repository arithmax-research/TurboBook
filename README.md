# TurboBook


TurboBook is a promising exploration into receiving, analyzing, and exploiting order book imperfections like imbalances and price mishaps using broker WebSockets and C++. The framework focuses on ultra-low latency processing of real-time market data to identify and capitalize on fleeting market opportunities.

## Current Capabilities

### Real-Time Market Data Processing
- **Binance WebSocket Integration**: Live cryptocurrency market depth data (BTCUSDT)
- **Alpaca WebSocket Integration**: Live stock market data with authentication
- **Dual-Feed Architecture**: Separate applications for crypto and equity markets
- **SSL/TLS Support**: Secure WebSocket connections with proper SNI configuration

### Order Book Management
- **High-Performance Order Book**: Efficient price-level based order book implementation
- **Real-Time Updates**: Processing of live market depth updates from exchanges
- **Order Matching Engine**: Built-in matching logic for trade simulation and analysis
- **Multi-Symbol Support**: Handles different trading instruments simultaneously

### Market Analysis Tools
- **Imbalance Detection**: Identifies order book imbalances across price levels
- **Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP)**: Calculates VWAP for both bid and ask sides
- **Order Flow Analysis**: Measures order flow imbalances for market sentiment
- **Price Level Analysis**: Deep analysis of bid-ask spreads and market depth

### Performance Metrics
- **Ultra-Low Latency**: Average order processing time of 7.89 microseconds
- **High Throughput**: Capable of processing 10,000 orders in 78.9 milliseconds
- **Real-Time Processing**: Live market data processing with microsecond precision
- **Efficient Memory Usage**: Optimized data structures for minimal memory footprint

## Usage

### Building the Project

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This creates three executables:
- `turbobook` - Main menu and project information
- `turbobook-binance` - Crypto market data analysis
- `turbobook-alpaca` - Stock market data analysis

### Running Applications

#### Crypto Market Analysis (Binance)
```bash
./turbobook-binance
```
- Connects to Binance WebSocket for BTCUSDT
- Collects live market depth data for 60 seconds
- Analyzes order book imbalances and market structure
- No API credentials required

#### Stock Market Analysis (Alpaca)
```bash
# Set environment variables
export ALPACA_API_KEY=your_api_key
export ALPACA_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Run the application
./turbobook-alpaca
```
- Connects to Alpaca WebSocket for AAPL
- Requires valid Alpaca API credentials
- Analyzes stock market microstructure
- Provides real-time equity market insights

#### Project Menu
```bash
./turbobook
```
Displays available applications and usage instructions.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `ALPACA_API_KEY`: Your Alpaca API key for stock market data
- `ALPACA_API_SECRET`: Your Alpaca API secret for authentication

### Supported Markets
- **Cryptocurrency**: Binance BTCUSDT perpetual futures
- **Equities**: Alpaca AAPL stock quotes and trades

## Architecture

### Core Components
- **OrderBook**: High-performance order book with price-time priority matching
- **OrderBookAnalyzer**: Advanced analytics for market microstructure analysis
- **BinanceWebSocketClient**: Real-time cryptocurrency data feed integration
- **AlpacaWebSocketClient**: Real-time equity data feed with authentication
- **MarketDataFeed**: Unified interface for multiple data sources

### Data Flow
1. WebSocket clients establish secure connections to exchanges
2. Real-time market data is parsed and validated
3. Order book is updated with live price/volume information
4. Analytics engine processes market microstructure
5. Imbalances and opportunities are identified and reported
